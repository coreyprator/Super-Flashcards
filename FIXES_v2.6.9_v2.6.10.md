# v2.6.9 & v2.6.10 Fixes Summary

## üêõ Issues Fixed in v2.6.9 (Deployed as revision 00072-cfl)

### **Issue #1: Sort Order Not Applying on Page Load**
**Problem**: User selected "Date Modified (Newest)" from dropdown, closed and reopened app. Dropdown showed "Newest" but cards were in random/insertion order.

**Root Cause**: `loadFlashcards()` loaded cards from cache but never sorted `state.flashcards`. The sort only happened in `renderFlashcardList()` for display, but the underlying array stayed unsorted.

**Fix**: 
1. Created `sortFlashcards(cards, sortOrder)` helper function
2. Added `state.flashcards = sortFlashcards(flashcards, state.sortOrder)` in `loadFlashcards()` line 438
3. Now cards are sorted immediately after loading, before any rendering

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/app.js` lines 438, 1410-1429

---

### **Issue #2: New Card Doesn't Display After Creation**
**Problem**: After creating "Gobbledygook" card with AI, a random card displayed instead of the newly created card.

**Root Cause**: `generateAIFlashcard()` tried to find the new card with `findIndex(c => c.id === flashcard.id)` but `state.flashcards` was loaded BEFORE the card was created. The new card wasn't in the array yet!

**Fix**: 
1. Added `await loadFlashcards()` to reload from cache after card creation (line 635)
2. Now finds the card in the refreshed `state.flashcards`
3. Displays the correct card

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/app.js` line 635

---

### **Issue #3: Creating Card Breaks Sort Order**
**Problem**: After creating a card, browse list showed random order.

**Root Cause**: Same as #2 - `state.flashcards` was out of sync with cache.

**Fix**: Reloading flashcards in `generateAIFlashcard()` fixed this too, since `loadFlashcards()` now applies sort order.

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/app.js` line 635 (same fix as #2)

---

### **Issue #4: UUID Delete Bug (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: Clicking delete on "Gobbledygook" card (UUID: `b9f000d9-a64a-4bd1-9818-eb20b77875b2`) didn't remove it from cache. Delete worked on other cards with numeric IDs but not UUIDs.

**Root Cause**: 
```javascript
if (id && !isNaN(id)) {  // ‚ùå BUG: UUIDs fail !isNaN() check
    await this.db.deleteFlashcard(parseInt(id));  // ‚ùå parseInt() on UUID = NaN
}
```
The `!isNaN(id)` check rejected UUIDs, so they were never deleted from cache.

**Fix**: 
1. Removed `!isNaN(id)` check in both places (line 107, line 133)
2. Pass ID as-is to `deleteFlashcard()` (works for both numbers and strings)
3. Removed `parseInt()` conversion

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/api-client.js` lines 107, 133

**Before**:
```javascript
if (id && !isNaN(id)) {
    await this.db.deleteFlashcard(parseInt(id));
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
if (id) {
    await this.db.deleteFlashcard(id);
}
```

## üêõ Issue Fixed in v2.6.10 (Deploying now as revision 00073)

### **Issue #5: Document Parser 404 Error**
**Problem**: When uploading Greek words text file, got error:
```
/api/parser/parse-document:1  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
Document parsing error: Error: Not Found
```

**Root Cause**: URL mismatch between frontend and backend:
- **Backend**: Router at `/api/document` with endpoint `/parse` = **Full path: `/api/document/parse`**
- **Frontend**: Calling `/api/parser/parse-document` ‚ùå

This was never caught because document parsing wasn't tested before!

**Fix**: Changed frontend URL from `/api/parser/parse-document` to `/api/document/parse`

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/app.js` line 3145

**Before**:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/parser/parse-document`, {
```

**After**:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/document/parse`, {
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test v2.6.10 (After Deployment Completes)

1. **Hard Refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear cache
2. **Verify Version**: Badge should show `v2.6.10`
3. **Test Sort Order**:
   - Click Browse tab
   - Dropdown should show "Date Modified (Newest)"
   - Cards should be in newest-first order (not random)
   - Close and reopen app
   - Order should persist (newest first)

4. **Test New Card Display**:
   - Create a new card (e.g., "Zorblax")
   - After creation, should immediately show "Zorblax" card
   - NOT a random card

5. **Test Delete (UUID)**:
   - Find any card with a UUID ID (long hex string)
   - Click delete button
   - Card should disappear immediately
   - Close and reopen app
   - Card should stay deleted (not reappear)

6. **Test Document Parser** (Greek Words):
   - Follow steps in `BATCH_GREEK_TEST.md`
   - Upload your Greek words `.txt` file
   - Should see word list table (not 404 error)
   - Select words and generate AI flashcards

## üîç What I Can't Test

Unfortunately, I **cannot** test the deployed application in a browser. I can only:
- ‚úÖ Read and analyze code
- ‚úÖ Find bugs by comparing frontend/backend
- ‚úÖ Make code changes
- ‚úÖ Run terminal commands (deploy, git, etc.)
- ‚ùå Open web browsers
- ‚ùå Click buttons in the UI
- ‚ùå Simulate user interactions
- ‚ùå Verify deployed behavior

**That's why** issues like:
- Sort order not applying (code looked correct but didn't work)
- Document parser URL mismatch (different endpoints)
- UUID delete bug (NaN check failed on UUIDs)

...weren't caught until you tested and reported them. 

I need your testing feedback to catch these runtime issues!

## üìù Recommendations

### For Future Development:
1. **Create automated UI tests** - Playwright or Cypress to test:
   - Card creation ‚Üí verify new card displays
   - Sort order ‚Üí verify persistence
   - Delete ‚Üí verify removal from UI and cache
   - Document upload ‚Üí verify parsing success

2. **Add API endpoint tests** - Test all endpoints:
   ```python
   def test_document_parser():
       response = client.post("/api/document/parse", files={"file": test_file})
       assert response.status_code == 200
   ```

3. **Add integration tests** - Test frontend + backend together:
   - Mock server responses
   - Verify correct URLs called
   - Verify cache behavior

4. **Local testing setup** - Document how to:
   - Run frontend locally (`python -m http.server 8000`)
   - Point to production backend
   - Test changes before deploying

This way you can test locally BEFORE deploying to production!

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed Now (After v2.6.10)

1. ‚úÖ Sort order applies on page load (newest first by default)
2. ‚úÖ Sort order persists across sessions (localStorage)
3. ‚úÖ New cards display immediately after creation
4. ‚úÖ Creating cards maintains sort order
5. ‚úÖ Delete works for UUID cards (not just numeric IDs)
6. ‚úÖ Document parser endpoint correct (can upload Greek words)

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Wait for v2.6.10 deployment** (~2-3 minutes)
2. **Hard refresh** your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Test document upload** with Greek words
4. **Follow steps** in `BATCH_GREEK_TEST.md`
5. **Report results** - how many words succeeded/failed

Let me know once v2.6.10 is deployed and you're ready to test the Greek words batch upload! üéâ
