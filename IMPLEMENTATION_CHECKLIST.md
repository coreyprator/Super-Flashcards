## üöÄ Deployment Command

Ready to deploy? Execute this command:

```bash
gcloud run domain-mappings create \
  --service super-flashcards \
  --domain learn.rentyourcio.com \
  --region us-central1
```

**Expected Result:**
```
Creating domain mapping...
Waiting for certificate provisioning...
‚úì Domain mapping created successfully
```

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If deployment fails or issues arise:

### Option 1: Use Fallback URL
- Application remains accessible at original URL
- No action needed
- URL: https://super-flashcards-57478301787.us-central1.run.app

### Option 2: Remove Domain Mapping
```bash
gcloud run domain-mappings delete learn.rentyourcio.com --region us-central1
```

### Option 3: Revert Code Changes
```bash
git revert HEAD~3
git push origin copilot/setup-subdomain-config
```

**Data Safety:** No risk - all changes are configuration only
