    "definition": "The word 'suscitare' is not a contemporary French term but appears to be a misspelling or confusion with 'sus-cité', which does not directly exist in French.

For example, 'Cette question a suscité beaucoup de débats' means 'This question has provoked a lot of debate'.",
    "etymology": "The verb 'susciter' comes from the Latin 'suscitare', which means to raise up, revive, or stir up. This Latin word is a compound of 'sub' (up from below) and 'citare' (to put in motion, to call), which is also the root of the English word 'cite'.",
