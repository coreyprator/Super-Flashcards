## 🚀 Next Steps for You

### 1. Review the Changes (Optional)

You can review the changes in this PR, but they're straightforward:
- One line added to CORS configuration
- Documentation updated to use correct domain

### 2. Execute Domain Mapping Command

**📖 Full instructions:** See `DEPLOYMENT_SUBDOMAIN.md`

**Quick version:**
```bash
gcloud run domain-mappings create \
  --service super-flashcards \
  --domain learn.rentyourcio.com \
  --region us-central1
```

**What this does:**
- Maps your custom domain to the Cloud Run service
- Triggers automatic SSL certificate provisioning
- Takes 5-15 minutes to complete

### 3. Wait for SSL Certificate

Google will automatically provision an SSL certificate. Monitor progress:
```bash
gcloud run domain-mappings describe learn.rentyourcio.com --region us-central1
```

Look for `status: ACTIVE`

### 4. Test Your Application

Once active, visit: https://learn.rentyourcio.com

**Login credentials:**
- Username: `beta`
- Password: `flashcards2025`

Test that all modes work: Study, Read, Browse
