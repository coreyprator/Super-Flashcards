# v2.6.29: Comprehensive Image & Audio Generation Debugging

**Deployment Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Issue**: Images and audio not being generated during batch flashcard creation

## Problem Analysis

From user testing:
- ✅ Batch generation creates flashcards successfully
- ✅ Cards are fetched and added to state
- ✅ Navigation works correctly
- ❌ **Images missing**: Generation takes only 16 seconds for 2 cards (should be 30-40s with DALL-E)
- ❌ **Audio missing**: `audio_url` is null, audio generation endpoint returns 404
- ❌ **No logs**: No "🎨 Generating image" messages in console logs

## Root Cause Hypothesis

1. **Image generation silently failing** - `generate_image()` called but returning None without logging
2. **Image generation skipped** - `include_images` or `image_description` validation failing
3. **Audio endpoint missing** - `/api/flashcards/{id}/generate-audio` doesn't exist

## Changes in v2.6.29

### 1. Database Logging Table

**New Model**: `APIDebugLog` in `backend/app/models.py`

Tracks every API operation with:
- Operation type (image_generation, audio_generation, batch_generate)
- Word being processed
- Status (started, success, failed, skipped)
- Current step
- Input data (JSON)
- Output data (JSON)
- Error messages and tracebacks
- Duration in milliseconds
- API provider and model

**Migration SQL**: `backend/migrations/create_api_debug_logs_table.sql`

```sql
CREATE TABLE api_debug_logs (
    id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY,
    flashcard_id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NULL,
    operation_type NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    word NVARCHAR(500) NULL,
    status NVARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    step NVARCHAR(100) NULL,
    input_data NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL,
    output_data NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL,
    error_message NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL,
    error_traceback NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL,
    duration_ms INT NULL,
    api_provider NVARCHAR(50) NULL,
    api_model NVARCHAR(50) NULL,
    created_at DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETDATE()
);
```

### 2. Verbose Image Generation Logging

**File**: `backend/app/routers/batch_ai_generate.py`

Enhanced image generation with:
- ✅ **Database logging** before and after each generation
- ✅ **Timing tracking** (start_time to duration_ms)
- ✅ **Success logging** with image URL and duration
- ✅ **Failure logging** with full error traceback
- ✅ **Skip logging** when validation fails (logs WHY it was skipped)

**New verbose logs:**
```
🎨 ===== IMAGE GENERATION START =====
🎨 Word: 'cardio'
🎨 Include images: True
🎨 Has image_description: True
🎨 Image description: A heart pumping blood through...
🎨 Calling generate_image() with verbose=True...
✅ IMAGE GENERATION SUCCESS
✅ Image URL: /images/cardio_abc123.png
✅ Duration: 12450ms
🎨 ===== IMAGE GENERATION END =====
```

### 3. Enhanced generate_image() Verbose Debugging

**File**: `backend/app/routers/ai_generate.py`

Comprehensive logging at every step:
- Entry point logging with all parameters
- DALL-E API request logging
- DALL-E API response logging
- Image download logging with byte count
- Cloud Storage upload logging
- Local fallback logging
- Content policy violation detection
- Full exception logging with tracebacks

**New verbose logs:**
```
🔍 VERBOSE: ========================================
🔍 VERBOSE: === ENTERING generate_image() ===
🔍 VERBOSE: Word: 'cardio'
🔍 VERBOSE: Description: 'A heart pumping blood...'
🔍 VERBOSE: ========================================
🔍 VERBOSE: --- Attempt 1: Word-based prompt ---
🔍 VERBOSE: Full prompt: 'Educational illustration...'
🔍 VERBOSE: >>> Sending request to DALL-E API...
🔍 VERBOSE: <<< DALL-E API response received!
🔍 VERBOSE: ✅ SUCCESS - Attempt 1 succeeded!
🔍 VERBOSE: DALL-E image URL: https://...
🔍 VERBOSE: --- Downloading image ---
🔍 VERBOSE: ✅ Downloaded 234567 bytes (229.07 KB)
🔍 VERBOSE: --- Uploading to Cloud Storage ---
🔍 VERBOSE: Filename: cardio_abc123.png
🔍 VERBOSE: ✅ Upload complete!
```

### 4. Skip Reason Logging

When image generation is skipped, the code now logs:
- Whether `include_images` is True/False
- Whether `image_description` exists
- The actual image_description value (first 500 chars)
- Saves this to database for analysis

This will reveal if:
- Frontend not sending `include_images: true`
- AI not generating `image_description`
- Some other validation failing

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration

Connect to Cloud SQL and run:
```bash
sqlcmd -S 35.224.242.223,1433 -U flashcards_user -P [password] -i backend/migrations/create_api_debug_logs_table.sql
```

Or manually run the SQL in SSMS/Azure Data Studio.

### 2. Deploy to Cloud Run

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "v2.6.29: Add comprehensive image/audio generation debugging with database logging"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy.

### 3. Test Batch Generation

Generate 1-2 Greek flashcards and observe:

**Expected in Cloud Run logs:**
```
🎨 ===== IMAGE GENERATION START =====
🎨 Word: 'test'
🎨 Include images: True
🎨 Has image_description: True
🔍 VERBOSE: === ENTERING generate_image() ===
🔍 VERBOSE: >>> Sending request to DALL-E API...
🔍 VERBOSE: <<< DALL-E API response received!
✅ IMAGE GENERATION SUCCESS
```

**Expected in database:**
```sql
SELECT TOP 10
    operation_type,
    word,
    status,
    step,
    duration_ms,
    error_message,
    created_at
FROM api_debug_logs
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Should show entries for each image generation attempt.

## Debugging Queries

### Check recent image generation attempts:
```sql
SELECT 
    word,
    status,
    step,
    duration_ms,
    api_provider,
    api_model,
    created_at
FROM api_debug_logs
WHERE operation_type = 'image_generation'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check failures:
```sql
SELECT 
    word,
    step,
    error_message,
    error_traceback,
    created_at
FROM api_debug_logs
WHERE status = 'failed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check skipped operations:
```sql
SELECT 
    word,
    input_data,
    error_message,
    created_at
FROM api_debug_logs
WHERE status = 'skipped'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Performance analysis:
```sql
SELECT 
    status,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    AVG(duration_ms) AS avg_duration_ms,
    MIN(duration_ms) AS min_duration_ms,
    MAX(duration_ms) AS max_duration_ms
FROM api_debug_logs
WHERE operation_type = 'image_generation'
    AND status IN ('success', 'failed')
GROUP BY status;
```

## Expected Outcomes

After deployment, we should be able to answer:

1. **Is `generate_image()` being called?**
   - Check for "🎨 IMAGE GENERATION START" in logs
   - Check database for `operation_type = 'image_generation'`

2. **Is DALL-E API being reached?**
   - Check for ">>> Sending request to DALL-E API..." in logs
   - Check `step = 'calling_dalle'` in database

3. **Is DALL-E responding?**
   - Check for "<<< DALL-E API response received!" in logs
   - Check `status = 'success'` and `step = 'completed'` in database

4. **Where is it failing?**
   - Check `error_message` and `error_traceback` in database
   - Check verbose logs for exception details

5. **Why is it being skipped?**
   - Check logs for "⚠️ Skipping image generation"
   - Check database entries with `status = 'skipped'`
   - Read `input_data` JSON to see validation values

## Next Steps

1. **Run migration** to create `api_debug_logs` table
2. **Deploy v2.6.29** to Cloud Run
3. **Test batch generation** with 1-2 words
4. **Check Cloud Run logs** for verbose output
5. **Query database** to see debug entries
6. **Analyze results** to identify exact failure point

This comprehensive debugging should reveal exactly where and why image generation is failing!
