- Google Cloud Run deployment
- Google Cloud SQL database (755+ flashcards)
- Google Cloud Storage (audio/images)
- Domain ready: learn.cbsware.com
- Basic Auth: beta/flashcards2025
- Cost: ~$12-17/month

**Data Migration:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Local SQL Server 2022 ‚Üí Cloud SQL Server 2019
- All 755 flashcards migrated successfully
- **Google Cloud SQL is now single source of truth**
- Local dev database is NOT authoritative

**Performance Work:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Cache-first strategy (language switching <100ms)
- Console errors eliminated
- Performance logging implemented
- Hotfix v2.5.5 deployed and verified

## üöÄ What's Next: Sprint 6 Phase 2 Scope

**Goal:** Transform single-user app into multi-user system with card sharing

**Timeline:** Next weekend (8-12 hours estimated)

**Features to implement:**

### 1. Database Backup (NEW - Based on Your Feedback)
- Set up automated nightly backups
- Test restore procedure
- Configure monitoring alerts
- **Priority:** Do this FIRST before schema changes

### 2. User Authentication
- FastAPI-Users integration
- Email/password registration
- Google OAuth ("Sign in with Google")
- JWT token management
- Session persistence

### 3. Database Schema Changes
**Connect to Google Cloud SQL (NOT local database!)**

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (...);

-- Add user ownership to flashcards
ALTER TABLE flashcards ADD created_by_user_id INT NULL;
ALTER TABLE flashcards ADD is_bootstrap BIT DEFAULT 0;

-- Mark existing 755 cards as bootstrap (visible to all)
UPDATE flashcards SET is_bootstrap = 1;

-- Collections table (many-to-many)
CREATE TABLE user_flashcard_collections (...);
```

### 4. Card Sharing System
- Duplicate detection before AI generation
- Instant add (reuse existing cards, save API costs)
- Browse modes: My Cards | Bootstrap | Community
- Multi-select batch add

### 5. Frontend Updates
- Login/registration UI
- User profile display
- Browse mode tabs
- "Add to Collection" button
- Duplicate detection notifications
