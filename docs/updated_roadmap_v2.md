# Language Learning Flashcards - Updated Roadmap v2

**Last Updated**: End of Sprint 1  
**Current Status**: Sprint 2 complete, ready for Sprint 3  
**Next Milestone**: Offline PWA + Spaced Repetition

- DALL-E 3 integration (image generation)
- Image download and local storage
- Windows Authentication support
- Environment configuration via .env

**Frontend** ‚úÖ
- Responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Tailwind
- Three-tab interface (Study, Add Card, Browse)
- Manual flashcard creation
- AI-powered flashcard generation
- Card flip animation

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

### Known Issues
1. **Image storage**: Filesystem ‚Üí need Cloudinary migration (Sprint 4)
2. **No database migrations**: Using direct schema create (consider Alembic)
3. **Updated_at trigger**: Manual, not automatic (add trigger)
4. **No API tests**: Only manual testing (add pytest suite)
5. **No full-text search**: Using LIKE queries (add CONTAINS indexes)

### Refactoring Opportunities
- [ ] Separate AI service layer
- [ ] Cache frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add API versioning (/api/v1/)
- [ ] Centralize error handling
- [ ] Add request validation middleware

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add Redis caching (when needed)
- [ ] Implement pagination (when >1000 cards)
- [ ] Optimize database queries (use SSMS profiler)
- [ ] Add CDN for images (Cloudinary)
- [ ] Compress API responses

### Documentation
- [ ] API reference (Swagger sufficient for now)
- [ ] User guide
- [ ] Video tutorials
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Contributing guidelines (if open source)

---

## Non-Goals

**We are NOT building**:
- Social network features (focus on learning)
- Gamification (no points, badges, levels)
- Live tutoring or chat
- Course marketplace
- Mobile games or mini-games
- Complex animations or effects
- Video/audio lessons (just flashcards)

**Scope Discipline**: Keep focused on flashcard-based learning with AI generation.

## Resource Requirements

### Development Time
- **Sprint 1**: ~40 hours (COMPLETE)
- **Sprint 2**: ~40 hours (estimated)
- **Sprint 3**: ~30 hours (estimated)
- **Sprint 4**: ~30 hours (estimated)
- **Total MVP**: ~140 hours (3-4 weeks full-time)

### Costs

**Development (Phase 1-2)**:
- Development: User's time (most valuable resource)
- OpenAI API: ~$5-10 per 100 flashcards with images
- Tools: $0 (all free/open source)

**Production (Phase 3+)**:
- Hosting: $10-25/month (Azure SQL + App Service)
- Cloudinary: $0-9/month (free tier sufficient)
- Domain: $10-15/year (optional)
- Total: ~$15-35/month

**Acceptable**: User prioritizes time savings over cost savings.

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Offline sync complexity**: Conflict resolution edge cases
  - **Mitigation**: Last-write-wins, extensive testing
  
- **Mobile browser limitations**: iOS service worker restrictions
  - **Mitigation**: Test on real devices early, PWA fallbacks

### Medium Risk
- **OpenAI API costs**: Runaway costs if not monitored
  - **Mitigation**: Set spending limits, track usage

- **Image storage scaling**: 10k cards = ~1GB images
  - **Mitigation**: Cloudinary migration planned

- **MS SQL Express 10GB limit**: Could hit limit eventually
  - **Mitigation**: Easy upgrade to Standard if needed

### Low Risk
- **Performance**: Should be fine for 10k cards
- **Security**: Standard practices, not handling PII
- **Deployment**: Multiple options, well-documented

---

## Decision Log

### Sprint 1 Decisions

**‚úÖ MS SQL Express instead of SQLite/PostgreSQL**
- **Rationale**: User has 20 years MS SQL experience
- **Result**: Zero learning curve, fast development
- **Status**: Confirmed correct decision

**‚úÖ Local image storage instead of Cloudinary Day 1**
- **Rationale**: Simplicity, iterate later
- **Result**: Working immediately, easy to migrate
- **Status**: Correct for Phase 1, will migrate Sprint 4

**‚úÖ Simple frontend instead of React**
- **Rationale**: Time optimization, no build complexity
- **Result**: Fast development, easy debugging
- **Status**: Correct, will keep for MVP

**‚úÖ Download DALL-E images instead of storing URLs**
- **Rationale**: URLs expire after 2 hours (fixed bug)
- **Result**: Images persist correctly
- **Status**: Critical fix, should have been Day 1

### Decisions to Make

**Sprint 2**:
- Leitner vs SM-2 algorithm? (Recommend: Leitner, simpler)
- IndexedDB vs LocalStorage? (Recommend: IndexedDB, more storage)
- Sync strategy? (Recommend: Last-write-wins)

**Sprint 4**:
- Azure SQL vs VPS? (Recommend: Azure, managed)
- Authentication provider? (Recommend: Custom JWT)
- Image CDN? (Recommend: Cloudinary)
