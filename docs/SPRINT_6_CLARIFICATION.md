# üéØ SPRINT 6 DEPLOYMENT - CURRENT STATUS & CLARIFICATION

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Purpose:** Clarify terminology and current deployment status  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Terminology Clarification

There is terminology overlap between two different work streams:

### VS Code AI's Documentation (PHASE_2_ROADMAP.md)
- **"Phase 1"** = Performance work (cache-first, console fixes) ‚úÖ DONE
- **"Phase 2"** = Future enhancements (asset pre-caching, Tailwind, analytics, SRS)
- **Timeline:** Future sprints (Sprint 7+)

### Your Sprint 6 Plan (USER_CARD_COLLECTIONS.md)
- **"Phase 1"** = Google Cloud deployment ‚úÖ ALREADY COMPLETE
- **"Phase 2"** = Multi-user authentication + card sharing
- **Timeline:** Next weekend (8-12 hours)

**These are DIFFERENT "Phase 2s"! This document clarifies the confusion.**

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT IS ALREADY COMPLETE

### Pre-Deployment Performance Work (VS Code AI's "Phase 1")
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and verified in production  
**What was done:**
- Cache-first strategy implemented (Revision 00030)
- Language switching optimized (2000ms ‚Üí <100ms)
- Console errors eliminated (401/404 fixed)
- Performance logging added
- Hotfix v2.5.5 deployed (Browse mode language switching)
- Production tested and verified

**Production URL:** <https://super-flashcards-57478301787.us-central1.run.app>

---

### Initial Google Cloud Deployment (Your Sprint 6 Phase 1)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Infrastructure deployed  
**What was done:**

1. **Database Migration**
   - ‚úÖ Local SQL Server 2022 database backed up
   - ‚úÖ SQL Server 2019-compatible backup created
   - ‚úÖ Cloud SQL instance provisioned (SQL Server 2019 Express)
   - ‚úÖ Database restored to Google Cloud SQL
   - ‚úÖ 755 flashcards migrated successfully
   - ‚úÖ Connection string updated in backend

2. **Asset Migration**
   - ‚úÖ Audio files uploaded to Google Cloud Storage
   - ‚úÖ Image files uploaded to Google Cloud Storage
   - ‚úÖ Backend configured to serve from Cloud Storage

3. **Application Deployment**
   - ‚úÖ FastAPI backend deployed to Google Cloud Run
   - ‚úÖ Frontend static files served by backend
   - ‚úÖ Environment variables configured
   - ‚úÖ Basic Auth implemented (beta/flashcards2025)

4. **Domain Setup**
   - ‚úÖ Domain registered: learn.cbsware.com
   - ‚úÖ Ready to map to Cloud Run service

**CRITICAL:** Google Cloud SQL is now the **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all data.
- Local dev database still exists but is NOT authoritative
- All production data lives in Cloud SQL
- All future development must connect to Cloud SQL

**Current Costs:** ~$12-17/month
- Cloud SQL: ~$10/month
- Cloud Storage: ~$1/month  
- Cloud Run: ~$1-6/month (depends on traffic)

---

## üéØ WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE: Sprint 6 Phase 2 (Multi-User)

**Timeline:** Next weekend (estimated 8-12 hours)  
**Goal:** Transform single-user app into multi-user system with card sharing

### 1. User Authentication System
**Technology:** FastAPI-Users  
**Features:**
- Email/password registration
- Google OAuth ("Sign in with Google")
- JWT token management
- Session persistence
- Password reset functionality

**Files to create:**
- `backend/app/auth.py` - Authentication logic
- `backend/app/models.py` - User model
- `frontend/auth.js` - Login/registration UI

---

### 2. Database Schema Changes

**Connect to:** Google Cloud SQL (NOT local database!)

**Schema Updates:**

```sql
-- Create users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    email NVARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    hashed_password NVARCHAR(1024) NOT NULL,
    username NVARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    is_superuser BIT DEFAULT 0,
    is_verified BIT DEFAULT 0,
    created_at DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Add user ownership to flashcards
ALTER TABLE flashcards ADD created_by_user_id INT NULL;
ALTER TABLE flashcards ADD is_bootstrap BIT DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE flashcards ADD times_shared INT DEFAULT 0;

-- Mark existing 755 cards as bootstrap (visible to all users)
UPDATE flashcards SET is_bootstrap = 1 WHERE created_by_user_id IS NULL;

-- Create many-to-many collection table
CREATE TABLE user_flashcard_collections (
    id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    flashcard_id INT NOT NULL,
    added_at DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    personal_notes NVARCHAR(MAX),
    CONSTRAINT FK_collections_users FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    CONSTRAINT FK_collections_flashcards FOREIGN KEY (flashcard_id) REFERENCES flashcards(id),
    CONSTRAINT UQ_user_flashcard UNIQUE (user_id, flashcard_id)
);
```

---

### 3. Card Sharing System

**Key Features:**

**Duplicate Detection:**
- Before AI generation, check if similar card exists
- Show notification: "This card already exists! Add to your collection?"
- Save API costs by reusing existing cards

**Instant Add:**
- User sees card created by another user
- Click "Add to My Collection" ‚Üí instant (no AI generation)
- Card appears in user's collection immediately

**Browse Modes:**
- **My Cards:** Cards I created + cards I've added
- **Bootstrap:** Original 755 cards (visible to everyone)
- **Community:** Cards created by other users (can add to collection)

**Multi-Select:**
- Browse Community cards
- Check multiple cards
- "Add Selected to My Collection" (batch operation)

**Reference:** See `USER_CARD_COLLECTIONS.md` for complete architecture

---

### 4. Frontend Updates

**New UI Components:**
- Login/Registration modal
- "Sign in with Google" button
- User profile display (top right)
- Browse mode tabs: My | Bootstrap | Community
- "Add to Collection" button on cards
- Duplicate detection notification
- Multi-select checkboxes in browse mode

**API Integration:**
- Add Authorization header to all requests
- Handle 401 responses (redirect to login)
- Store JWT token in localStorage
- Refresh token logic

---

## üìã WHAT WILL NOT BE DONE IN SPRINT 6

The following features from VS Code AI's PHASE_2_ROADMAP.md are **FUTURE work** (Sprint 7+):

### Deferred to Future Sprints:
- ‚ùå Bulk Asset Pre-Caching - Sprint 7
- ‚ùå Tailwind Local Installation - Sprint 7
- ‚ùå Study Analytics Dashboard - Sprint 8
- ‚ùå Spaced Repetition System (SRS) - Sprint 8
- ‚ùå Japanese Kanji Enhancements - Sprint 9
- ‚ùå Additional Languages - Sprint 9

**Reason:** Sprint 6 Phase 2 focuses ONLY on user authentication and card sharing. Other enhancements come later.

---

## üîê Database Backup Strategy (NEW REQUIREMENT)

**Priority:** HIGH - Implement early in Sprint 6 Phase 2

### Automated Nightly Backups

**Solution:** Google Cloud SQL Automated Backups

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Enable automated backups (via Cloud Console or gcloud)
gcloud sql instances patch super-flashcards-db \
    --backup-start-time=02:00 \
    --enable-bin-log \
    --retained-backups-count=30
```

**Backup Policy:**
- **Frequency:** Daily at 2:00 AM UTC
- **Retention:** 30 days
- **Location:** Same region as database (us-central1)
- **Binary logs:** Enabled (for point-in-time recovery)

**Test Restore Procedure:**
1. Create test instance from backup
2. Verify data integrity (count flashcards, check languages)
3. Test application connection
4. Delete test instance

**Cost:** Included in Cloud SQL pricing (~$10/month already budgeted)

**Alternative (if more control needed):**
- Create Cloud Function triggered by Cloud Scheduler
- Export database to Cloud Storage bucket
- Separate from Cloud SQL automated backups
- Additional cost: ~$0.10/month for storage
