### 🔍 Data Processing Pipeline

**Phase 1: Document Processing**

```text
Input: 3 documents (211 pages primary + 2 supplementary)
↓
Extract vocabulary using regex patterns
↓
Character encoding fixes (àáâ normalization)
↓
Output: 3,943 unique French words
```

**Phase 2: Curation & Selection**

```text
Manual review in Excel/CSV
↓
User selects 266 high-priority words
↓
Exclude existing flashcards and test samples
↓
Final batch: 253 words for processing
```

**Phase 3: AI Generation**

```text
For each word:
  → GPT-4: Generate definition + etymology
  → DALL-E 3: Create custom image
  → Save to database
  → Update progress
Average time: 95 seconds per word
```

## 📚 LESSONS LEARNED

### 🎯 Critical Success Factors

**1. Server Stability First**

- **Issue**: Document parser caused server crashes on HTTP requests
- **Solution**: Removed problematic routers (`document_parser.py`, `search.py`)
- **Lesson**: Always verify server stability before adding complex features

**2. API Integration Complexity**

- **Issue**: Initial batch processing used mock data instead of real AI calls
- **Solution**: Fixed endpoint URLs and verified API integration separately
- **Lesson**: Test individual components before building batch systems

**3. Error Handling is Essential**

- **Issue**: Long-running processes (6+ hours) are vulnerable to crashes
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive error handling with resume capability
- **Lesson**: Build robust systems for production-scale processing

**4. Progress Visibility Matters**

- **Issue**: Users couldn't tell if processing was working correctly
- **Solution**: Real-time progress bars, ETA calculations, and incremental saving
- **Lesson**: User feedback is critical for long-running operations

### 🔧 Technical Insights

**Character Encoding Challenges**

- French text requires careful UTF-8 handling
- Implemented fallback encodings: `utf-8 → latin-1 → cp1252 → iso-8859-1`
- Character mapping for special cases: `àáâãäå → à`, etc.

**OpenAI API Optimization**

- GPT-4 + DALL-E 3 averages 95 seconds per word
- Proper timeout handling (5 minutes) prevents hanging
- Server health checks prevent processing when API is down

**Database Performance**

- Batch inserts work well for large datasets
- Progress saving every 10 words balances performance vs. safety
- Existing flashcard detection prevents duplicates
