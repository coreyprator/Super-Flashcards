# Sprint Summary - Audio & Search Improvements

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Sprint Focus:** Audio regeneration, search functionality, and user experience improvements

## üéØ Sprint Objectives Met

### ‚úÖ Audio Regeneration System
- **Problem:** Audio regeneration created new files but frontend continued playing cached old files
- **Solution:** Implemented frontend refresh system that updates card display after successful audio generation
- **Impact:** Users now immediately hear corrected audio without manual page refresh

### ‚úÖ Search Functionality 
- **Problem:** Search was failing with 404 errors despite backend capability
- **Root Cause:** API URL mismatch (`/api/search/flashcards` vs `/api/flashcards/search`)
- **Solution:** Corrected URL routing and response parsing
- **Impact:** Search now works for word, definition, and etymology fields across all languages

### ‚úÖ Accurate Server Timing
- **Problem:** Startup logs showed misleading sub-second times instead of actual ~35 second startup
- **Solution:** Enhanced timing measurement from script execution to application ready state
- **Impact:** Developers now see realistic performance metrics for optimization

### ‚úÖ User Experience Enhancements
- **Auto-Language Selection:** Remembers last selected language using localStorage
- **Translation Subtitles:** Shows English definition under foreign words on card backs
- **Improved Feedback:** Better error handling and user notifications

## üîß Technical Achievements

### Audio System Improvements
- **File Management:** Timestamped filenames prevent browser caching issues
- **Frontend Integration:** `refreshCurrentCard()` function ensures UI synchronization
- **Google TTS Integration:** Stable pronunciation generation with Greek language support

### Search Architecture 
- **Multi-field Search:** Searches across word_or_phrase, definition, and etymology
- **OR Logic Implementation:** Finds cards matching any field (standard search behavior)
- **Language Filtering:** Respects current language selection for targeted results

### Performance Monitoring
- **Full-Stack Timing:** Measures from PowerShell script start to application ready
- **Environment Variable Passing:** Coordinates timing between script and application
- **Startup Event Handling:** Accurate completion detection via FastAPI events

## üìä Lessons Learned

### Google TTS vs OpenAI
- **Google TTS:** Faster, more reliable, better Greek pronunciation
- **Cost Effective:** Lower cost per character than OpenAI
- **Voice Quality:** Wavenet voices provide natural pronunciation
- **Recommendation:** Continue with Google TTS for production

### Frontend State Management
- **Cache Busting:** Timestamp-based filenames essential for audio updates
- **UI Synchronization:** Manual refresh required after async operations
- **LocalStorage:** Effective for simple user preference persistence

### API Design Patterns
- **URL Structure:** Consistent `/api/resource/action` pattern
- **Response Format:** Direct arrays vs wrapped objects impact frontend parsing
- **Error Handling:** Clear 404 responses help debug routing issues

### Development Process
- **Incremental Testing:** Small changes with immediate verification
- **User Feedback Integration:** Real user experience drives improvement priorities
- **Performance Measurement:** Accurate timing enables optimization decisions
