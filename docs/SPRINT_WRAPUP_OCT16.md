   - ✅ Imported 140 curated French/Greek phrases
   - ✅ Generated audio for 142/144 cards (99% success)
   - 🔄 Generating images for 150 cards (in progress, ~3-7 hours)

## 📊 Database Status

**Total Flashcards:** 492
- French: 357 cards
- Greek: 130 cards  
- English: 5 cards

**Multimedia Enrichment:**
- Audio: 490/492 (99.6%)
- Images: ~150 in progress

## 🛠️ Technical Achievements

### Code Changes
1. **Backend API**
   - `schemas.py`: Made `times_reviewed` Optional[int] to handle NULL
   - `flashcards.py`: Increased default limit to 1000 cards
   
2. **Frontend**
   - Cache-busting version updates (v2.5.1, v5.2.1, v5.1.1)
   
3. **New Tools Created**
   - `import_bootstrap_simple.py` - Direct database import
   - `batch_audio_bootstrap.py` - Batch TTS generation
   - `batch_images_bootstrap.py` - Batch image generation
   - `batch_bootstrap_enrichment.py` - Status checker
   - `check_db_vs_api.py` - Diagnostic comparisons

### Architecture Insights
- **Port 8000**: FastAPI serves both API and frontend static files
- **Single-server architecture**: Simpler than initially understood
- **Batch processing**: Created reusable patterns for future content imports

---

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. **Browser Cache Aggression**
   - Problem: JavaScript files heavily cached
   - Solution: Query string versioning + incognito testing

2. **API Pagination**
   - Problem: Only returning 100 of 492 cards
   - Solution: Increased default limit to 1000

3. **NULL Value Handling**
   - Problem: Pydantic validation failing on NULL `times_reviewed`
   - Solution: Changed schema to Optional[int] = 0

4. **Terminal Management**
   - Problem: Commands interfering with background processes
   - Solution: Created standalone scripts for manual execution

---

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅
- Direct database scripts for bulk operations (bypassing API overhead)
- Incremental batch processing with resume capability
- Diagnostic scripts for comparing database vs API results
- Clear separation of concerns (import → audio → images)

### What Could Be Improved 💡
- Terminal automation is tricky with background processes
- Image generation is slow (~3 minutes per image)
- Could benefit from concurrent processing for images
- Need better timeout handling for long-running operations

### Best Practices Established 🌟
- Always check database directly when API behaves unexpectedly
- Use incognito mode for cache-related debugging
- Create idempotent scripts (safe to re-run)
- Log progress for long-running batch operations
