## What You Need to Tell VS AI

**Copy/paste this to VS AI:**

```
Hi VS AI,

Sprint 3 handoff from Claude. Server is crashing after adding new code. Need you to:

1. FIX SERVER: Remove broken files that are causing crashes
   - Delete: backend/app/routers/search.py (if exists)
   - Delete: backend/app/routers/import_tools.py (if exists)
   - Clean up any references in backend/app/main.py
   - Test that server starts and works

2. IMPLEMENT BATCH IMPORT: Add simple batch word processing
   - Create: backend/scripts/extract_words.py
   - Create: backend/app/routers/batch_import.py
   - Update: frontend with batch import UI
   - Register router in main.py

See full handoff document attached for complete code and specifications.

Success criteria:
- Server runs without crashing
- Can upload CSV word list
- Batch processing works with progress bar
- Words become flashcards automatically

Timeline: ~3-4 hours development time
```

## What You Need to Do

### **TODAY:**

**Step 1: Export Google Docs** (5 minutes)
1. Open each of your 3 French Google Docs
2. File â†’ Download â†’ Plain Text (.txt)
3. Save as: `french_doc1.txt`, `french_doc2.txt`, `french_doc3.txt`

**Step 2: Give VS AI the Handoff** (2 minutes)
1. Copy the full "VS AI Handoff" document (the artifact above)
2. Paste into VS AI
3. Ask VS AI to implement both parts

**Step 3: Wait for VS AI** (Let it work)
- VS AI will fix the server
- VS AI will implement batch import
- Should take 3-4 hours

### **AFTER VS AI FINISHES:**

**Step 4: Extract Words** (5 minutes)
```powershell
# Run the word extractor on your 3 files
python backend\scripts\extract_words.py french_doc1.txt french_doc2.txt french_doc3.txt -o all_words.csv

# Expected output: CSV with ~500-1000 words
```

**Step 5: Curate Word List** (15 minutes)
1. Open `all_words.csv` in Excel
2. Delete unwanted words (English words, common articles, etc.)
3. Keep vocabulary words you want to learn
4. Save as `curated_words.csv`

**Step 6: Batch Import** (1 hour - computer does the work!)
1. Start server: `.\runui.ps1`
2. Go to Import tab
3. Upload `curated_words.csv`
4. Click "Start Processing"
5. Go make coffee â˜• - watch progress bar
6. Come back to 500 new flashcards! ðŸŽ‰
