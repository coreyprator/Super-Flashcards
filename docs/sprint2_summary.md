# Sprint 2 Summary - Quick Reference

**For sharing with VS Code AI**

---

## What Changed in Sprint 2 Plan

**Original Plan**: Full offline sync + IndexedDB + Spaced repetition  
**Revised Plan**: CRUD UI enhancements + Basic PWA setup

**Reason**: User needs to fix/edit flashcards first (higher priority than offline sync)

---

## Sprint 2 Goals

### Priority 1: CRUD UI (Days 1-3)
1. Edit flashcard modal
2. Delete confirmation
3. Improve manual entry form
4. Image management

### Priority 2: PWA Basics (Days 4-5)
1. Service worker for caching
2. PWA manifest
3. Install prompt

### Priority 3: Nice to Have (If Time)
1. Bulk operations
2. Simple spaced repetition

## Key Points for VS Code AI

**No Backend Changes Needed**
- All API endpoints exist and work
- PUT /api/flashcards/{id} ✅
- DELETE /api/flashcards/{id} ✅
- Just need UI to call these

**Files to Modify**
```
frontend/
├── index.html  # Add edit/delete modals
└── app.js      # Add CRUD functions
```

**Files to Create**
```
frontend/
├── sw.js           # Service worker
├── manifest.json   # PWA manifest
└── offline.html    # Fallback page
```

**Implementation Order**
1. Edit modal (highest priority)
2. Delete confirmation
3. Form improvements
4. Service worker
5. PWA manifest

## What User Wants

**Immediate Needs**:
- Fix mistakes in AI-generated content
- Remove test cards
- Better multi-line entry (textareas)
- Manage images (remove/regenerate)

**Future Needs** (Sprint 3):
- Full offline sync with IndexedDB
- Spaced repetition algorithm
- Mobile swipe gestures

## Documents to Reference

**For Implementation**:
1. `Sprint 2 Kickoff Document.md` - Complete feature specs
2. `Sprint 2 Implementation Guide - VS Code AI.md` - Code examples
3. `VS Code AI Brief - Project Context.md` - Project context

**For Architecture**:
1. `Claude Project Instructions - Language Learning.md` - Communication rules
2. `AI Collaboration Protocol - Claude & VS Code AI.md` - Role boundaries

## Success = Working CRUD + Installable PWA

**Must Work**:
- ✅ Edit flashcard from browse list
- ✅ Delete flashcard with confirmation
- ✅ Better form (textareas, placeholders)
- ✅ App installable on desktop
- ✅ Service worker caching

**Test On**:
- Desktop Chrome (edit/delete/install)
- Mobile Safari (edit/delete)
- Offline mode (cached assets load)

---

## Quick Start for VS Code AI

1. Read `Sprint 2 Implementation Guide - VS Code AI.md`
2. Start with edit modal (copy HTML + JS from guide)
3. Test edit works
4. Add delete confirmation
5. Test delete works
6. Improve form
7. Add service worker
8. Test install

---

**Focus**: CRUD UI first (users can't edit their cards!), then PWA basics.

**Timeline**: 5-7 days total, CRUD should be done in 3 days.
