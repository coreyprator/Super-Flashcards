## 🚀 Starting Phase 2 - Recommended Approach

### Step 1: Orient New AI Agent
When starting a new conversation with Claude:

```
I'm taking over Phase 2 development for Super Flashcards. Please read:
1. docs/HANDOFF_PACKAGE.md (complete context)
2. docs/PHASE_2_ROADMAP.md (what to build)
3. docs/REVISION_00030_NOTES.md (current architecture)

Let's start with the highest priority feature: Bulk Asset Pre-Caching.
```

### Step 2: First Feature - Bulk Asset Pre-Caching
**Why this first:** Biggest UX improvement, completes offline-first vision

**What to build:**
- "Download for Offline Use" button per language
- Background asset fetching with progress UI
- Show "Caching 45/758 assets..." with progress bar
- Can cancel/pause download
- Storage management (show size, allow clearing)

**Expected outcome:**
- User clicks button → all audio/images download
- After completion, entire language works offline
- No need to navigate cards individually

**Files to modify:**
- `frontend/app.js` - Add pre-caching functions
- `frontend/db.js` - Asset cache management
- `frontend/index.html` - Progress UI elements
- `frontend/styles.css` - Progress bar styling

**Estimated time:** 4-6 hours

### Step 3: Second Feature - Tailwind Local Install
**Why this second:** Quick win, removes last CDN dependency

**What to build:**
- Install Tailwind CSS locally via npm
- Build optimized CSS file (only used classes)
- Update index.html to use local CSS
- Add build step to deployment pipeline

**Expected outcome:**
- No more CDN warning in console
- Faster load times (no external request)
- Smaller CSS file (<100KB minified)
- True offline-first capability

**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours

### Step 4: Third Feature - Multi-User Authentication
**Why this third:** Foundation for all future personalization features

**What to build:**
- Google OAuth 2.0 sign-in
- JWT token management
- User database table
- Per-user data filtering
- User settings/preferences

**Expected outcome:**
- Users can create accounts and log in
- Each user sees only their flashcards
- Session persists across browser restarts
- Ready for personalization features (analytics, SRS, etc.)

**Estimated time:** 8-12 hours
