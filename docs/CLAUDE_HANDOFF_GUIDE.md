### Backend Files

**API & Database:**

## üöÄ Recommended Sharing Strategy for Phase 2 Start

### Initial Conversation with Claude:

**Step 1: Share Context (At Start)**
```
Attach:
- docs/HANDOFF_PACKAGE.md
- docs/PHASE_2_ROADMAP.md
```

**Step 2: Your Prompt**
```
Hi Claude! I'm starting Phase 2 development for Super Flashcards.

Phase 1 is complete and verified in production:
‚úÖ Cache-first strategy (language switching <100ms)
‚úÖ All console errors fixed
‚úÖ Performance logging implemented
‚úÖ Hotfix v2.5.5 deployed successfully

I've attached two documents:
1. HANDOFF_PACKAGE.md - Complete project context
2. PHASE_2_ROADMAP.md - What to build next

Please review both documents. We'll start with the highest priority 
feature: Bulk Asset Pre-Caching System.

Questions:
1. Do you understand the current architecture?
2. Are you ready to start implementing the pre-caching feature?
```

**Step 3: Share Code Files (When Claude Asks)**

Claude will likely ask to see specific files. Be ready to share:
- `frontend/app.js` (when implementing pre-caching logic)
- `frontend/db.js` (when adding cache management)
- `frontend/index.html` (when adding progress UI)

## üéØ Common Scenarios & What to Share

### Scenario 1: Starting Phase 2 from scratch
**Share:** HANDOFF_PACKAGE.md + PHASE_2_ROADMAP.md  
**Why:** Provides complete context and feature list

### Scenario 2: Claude asks about Phase 1 implementation details
**Share:** REVISION_00030_NOTES.md  
**Why:** Has detailed technical notes on all Phase 1 features

### Scenario 3: Claude needs to understand cache-first strategy
**Share:** REVISION_00030_NOTES.md (Cache-First section)  
**Why:** Contains implementation details and code examples

### Scenario 4: Claude asks about database schema
**Share:** `backend/scripts/init_db.py`  
**Why:** Complete schema definition with relationships

### Scenario 5: Claude needs to see current UI structure
**Share:** `frontend/index.html` + `frontend/app.js`  
**Why:** Shows complete DOM structure and event handlers

### Scenario 6: Claude asks about version numbers
**Share:** PHASE_1_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md (Key Information section)  
**Why:** Lists all current version numbers

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What NOT to Share (Unnecessary for Phase 2)

- ‚ùå Old backup files in `backup-copilot-version/`
- ‚ùå Git commit history (unless debugging specific change)
- ‚ùå Environment files (`.env` - never share, has secrets)
- ‚ùå Build logs (unless debugging deployment)

```
Feature: [Feature Name from PHASE_2_ROADMAP.md]

Context:
- I've already shared HANDOFF_PACKAGE.md and PHASE_2_ROADMAP.md
- Current version: app.js v2.5.5, db.js v5.2.1, api-client.js v5.3.0
- Production URL: https://super-flashcards-57478301787.us-central1.run.app

Goal:
[Copy goal from PHASE_2_ROADMAP.md]

[Copy technical approach from PHASE_2_ROADMAP.md]

Files to Modify:
[Copy file list from PHASE_2_ROADMAP.md]

Please help me:
1. Review the implementation plan
2. Write the code for this feature

## üéØ Success Indicators

**You'll know Claude is properly oriented when:**

‚úÖ Claude references specific Phase 1 features (cache-first strategy)  
‚úÖ Claude mentions version numbers correctly  
‚úÖ Claude understands the 3-mode system (Study/Read/Browse)  
‚úÖ Claude asks relevant questions about implementation details  
‚úÖ Claude suggests code that follows existing patterns  
‚úÖ Claude remembers to update version numbers when editing JS files

**Red flags that Claude needs more context:**

‚ùå Claude suggests breaking changes to Phase 1 features  
‚ùå Claude doesn't understand cache-first architecture  
‚ùå Claude forgets to update version numbers  
‚ùå Claude suggests technologies not in current stack  
‚ùå Claude doesn't know about the 3-mode system

---

## üìû Emergency Reference

**If Claude seems confused:**

1. **Stop** current task
2. **Share** HANDOFF_PACKAGE.md again
3. **Ask** Claude to summarize understanding of:
   - Current architecture
   - Phase 1 accomplishments
   - Feature being implemented
4. **Clarify** any misunderstandings before continuing

**Key reminder for Claude:**
"Remember: Phase 1 is complete and working in production. We're building NEW features on top of the existing foundation. Don't change what's already working!"
