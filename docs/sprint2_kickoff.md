# Sprint 2 Kickoff Document
**Project**: Language Learning Flashcards  
**Sprint Focus**: CRUD UI Enhancements + PWA Foundation  
**Start Date**: After Sprint 1 git push  
**Estimated Duration**: 5-7 days

---

## Sprint Goal

Complete the CRUD interface for flashcards and lay foundation for offline PWA support.

**Priority 1**: Fix/improve basic CRUD operations (edit, delete, better forms)  
**Priority 2**: PWA infrastructure (service worker, offline basics)  
**Priority 3**: Basic spaced repetition (if time permits)

---

## Sprint 2 Features

### Phase A: CRUD UI Enhancements (Must Have)

These are the missing pieces from Sprint 1 MVP:

#### 1. Edit Flashcard UI
**Status**: Backend API exists (PUT /api/flashcards/{id}), UI missing

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Edit button on flashcard browse view
- [ ] Edit button on study view
- [ ] Modal or dedicated edit page
- [ ] Pre-populate form with existing data
- [ ] Save updates to database
- [ ] Update display immediately (no page refresh)

**UI Flow**:
```
User on Study/Browse â†’ Click "Edit" button 
  â†’ Modal appears with current data
  â†’ User modifies fields
  â†’ Click "Save" 
  â†’ API call: PUT /api/flashcards/{id}
  â†’ Modal closes, card updates
```

**Fields to Edit**:
- word_or_phrase
- definition
- etymology
- english_cognates
- related_words (comma-separated in UI)
- image_url (can change/remove)

#### 2. Delete Flashcard UI
**Status**: Backend API exists (DELETE /api/flashcards/{id}), UI missing

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Delete button on flashcard browse view
- [ ] Delete button in edit modal
- [ ] Confirmation dialog ("Are you sure?")
- [ ] Remove from display immediately
- [ ] Handle if user is studying deleted card

**UI Flow**:
```
User on Browse â†’ Click "Delete" (trash icon)
  â†’ Confirmation: "Delete '[word]'? This cannot be undone."
  â†’ User confirms
  â†’ API call: DELETE /api/flashcards/{id}
  â†’ Card removed from list
```

**Edge Cases**:
- If deleting currently studied card â†’ navigate to next/prev
- If deleting last card â†’ show "no cards" message
- If delete fails â†’ show error, don't remove from UI

#### 3. Improved Manual Card Form
**Status**: Basic form exists, needs enhancements

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Better layout and spacing
- [ ] Textarea for definition (multi-line)
- [ ] Textarea for etymology (multi-line)
- [ ] Helpful placeholders with examples
- [ ] Character counters (optional)
- [ ] Clear/reset button
- [ ] Form validation (word required)

**Example Placeholders**:
```
Word/Phrase: e.g., "susciter"
Definition: How is this word used? Provide context...
Etymology: From Latin "suscitare" meaning...
English Cognates: resuscitate, excite, incite
Related Words: provoquer, engendrer (comma-separated)
```

#### 4. Image Management
**Status**: Images save but no UI to change/remove

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Display current image in edit modal
- [ ] "Remove image" button
- [ ] "Regenerate image" button (calls AI again)
- [ ] Show image preview when editing
- [ ] Option to upload custom image (Phase 2.5)

**UI in Edit Modal**:
```
Current Image: [thumbnail display]
[Remove Image] [Regenerate with AI]
```

#### 5. Bulk Operations (Nice to Have)
**Status**: Not implemented

**Requirements** (if time permits):
- [ ] Select multiple cards (checkboxes)
- [ ] Delete selected
- [ ] Change language for selected
- [ ] Export selected to CSV

---

### Phase B: PWA Foundation (Should Have)

#### 1. Service Worker Basics
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Create `frontend/sw.js`
- [ ] Register service worker in `app.js`
- [ ] Cache static assets (HTML, CSS, JS)
- [ ] Cache Tailwind CDN
- [ ] Offline fallback page
- [ ] Test offline mode

**Files to Create**:
```
frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ sw.js                   # Service worker
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json           # PWA manifest
â””â”€â”€ offline.html            # Offline fallback page
```

**Service Worker Strategy**:
- Cache-first for static assets
- Network-first for API calls
- Offline page when network fails

#### 2. PWA Manifest
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Create `manifest.json`
- [ ] Define app name, icons, colors
- [ ] Set display: standalone
- [ ] Configure start_url
- [ ] Link in `index.html`

**Minimal Manifest**:
```json
{
  "name": "Language Learning Flashcards",
  "short_name": "Flashcards",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#4F46E5",
  "icons": [...]
}
```

#### 3. Install Prompt
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Detect if installable
- [ ] Show install banner/button
- [ ] Handle beforeinstallprompt event
- [ ] Hide after installation
- [ ] iOS instructions (Add to Home Screen)

---

### Phase C: Basic Spaced Repetition (If Time Permits)

**Note**: Lower priority than CRUD UI fixes.

#### 1. Simple Review Scheduling
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Mark card difficulty (Easy/Hard buttons)
- [ ] Calculate next review date
- [ ] Store in last_reviewed field
- [ ] "Due for review" filter
- [ ] Sort by due date

**Algorithm** (Simple version):
```
Easy: Review in 7 days
Medium: Review in 3 days  
Hard: Review tomorrow
```

#### 2. Study Session Tracking
**Requirements**:
- [ ] Use study_sessions table
- [ ] Track: card reviewed, difficulty rating, time
- [ ] Show session summary at end
- [ ] "Cards reviewed today" counter

---

## Technical Implementation

### CRUD Operations - API Endpoints Already Exist

**No backend changes needed** for basic CRUD:
- âœ… GET /api/flashcards - List cards
- âœ… GET /api/flashcards/{id} - Get single card
- âœ… POST /api/flashcards - Create card
- âœ… PUT /api/flashcards/{id} - Update card
- âœ… DELETE /api/flashcards/{id} - Delete card

**Frontend needs**: UI to call these endpoints

### Frontend Changes Needed

**Update `frontend/app.js`**:
```javascript
// Add these functions:

async function editFlashcard(id, data) {
    const response = await apiRequest(`/flashcards/${id}`, {
        method: 'PUT',
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });
    return response;
}

async function deleteFlashcard(id) {
    const response = await apiRequest(`/flashcards/${id}`, {
        method: 'DELETE'
    });
    return response;
}

function showEditModal(flashcard) {
    // Display modal with flashcard data
    // Pre-populate form fields
}

function confirmDelete(flashcard) {
    // Show confirmation dialog
    // If confirmed, call deleteFlashcard()
}
```

**Update `frontend/index.html`**:
```html
<!-- Add Edit Modal -->
<div id="edit-modal" class="hidden fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 z-50">
    <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto mt-20">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Edit Flashcard</h2>
        <form id="edit-flashcard-form">
            <!-- Form fields -->
        </form>
        <div class="mt-4 flex space-x-2">
            <button id="save-edit-btn">Save Changes</button>
            <button id="cancel-edit-btn">Cancel</button>
            <button id="delete-from-edit-btn" class="bg-red-600">Delete</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Add Delete Confirmation Modal -->
<div id="delete-modal" class="hidden fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 z-50">
    <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-8 max-w-md mx-auto mt-40">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Delete Flashcard?</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Are you sure you want to delete "<span id="delete-word"></span>"?</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-red-600 mb-6">This action cannot be undone.</p>
        <div class="flex space-x-2">
            <button id="confirm-delete-btn" class="bg-red-600">Delete</button>
            <button id="cancel-delete-btn">Cancel</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Files to Modify

### Frontend Changes
```
frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Add edit and delete modals
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js              # Add edit/delete functions, modal handlers
â””â”€â”€ (new) sw.js         # Service worker for offline
â””â”€â”€ (new) manifest.json # PWA manifest
```

### No Backend Changes
- API endpoints already functional
- Database schema supports all operations
- May add image regeneration endpoint (optional)

---

## Current Issues to Fix

Based on Sprint 1 handoff, these are known pain points:

1. **No edit capability**: Can't fix AI-generated content mistakes
2. **No delete UI**: Can't remove test/bad cards
3. **Form is basic**: Hard to enter multi-line content
4. **No image management**: Can't change or remove images
5. **Manual entry workflow**: Could be smoother

---

## Testing Checklist

### CRUD Testing
- [ ] Create flashcard manually
- [ ] Create flashcard with AI
- [ ] Edit existing flashcard
- [ ] Save changes persist to database
- [ ] Delete flashcard from browse view
- [ ] Delete flashcard from study view
- [ ] Delete last card shows appropriate message
- [ ] Form validation prevents empty words
- [ ] Multi-line text in definition/etymology works
- [ ] Image removal works
- [ ] Related words comma-separated format works

### PWA Testing
- [ ] Service worker registers successfully
- [ ] Static assets cached
- [ ] Offline page displays when no network
- [ ] Manifest linked and valid
- [ ] Install prompt appears (desktop Chrome)
- [ ] iOS instructions clear
