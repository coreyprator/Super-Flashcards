## üóÇÔ∏è **PROJECT ARCHITECTURE**

### Backend (`/backend/`)
- **FastAPI** framework with service-oriented architecture
- **Main Application:** `app/main.py` - Entry point with router registration
- **Database:** `app/models.py`, `app/schemas.py` - MSSQL schema definitions
- **Services:** 
  - `services/google_tts_service.py` - Audio generation
  - `services/audio_service.py` - Audio file management  
  - `services/ai_service.py` - OpenAI integration
- **Routers:** RESTful API endpoints in `routers/` directory
- **Scripts:** `runui.ps1` - Production startup script with timing

### Frontend (`/frontend/`)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** SPA with tab-based navigation
- **Main App:** `app.js` - Core application logic and state management
- **Audio Player:** `audio-player.js` - TTS playback and regeneration
- **Responsive UI** with Tailwind-inspired styling

### Database Schema
- **flashcards** - Core card data with multimedia URLs
- **languages** - Supported language definitions
- **users** - User management (prepared for future)
- **study_sessions** - Learning progress tracking (prepared)

## üõ†Ô∏è **DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT**

### Setup Commands
```powershell
# Start application (recommended)
.\runui.ps1

# Manual backend start
cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend (if separate)
cd frontend && python -m http.server 3000
```

## üîç **DEBUGGING QUICK REFERENCE**

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Search Not Working:** Check API URL routing in `app.js`
2. **Audio Not Playing:** Verify file paths and browser cache
3. **Server Won't Start:** Check MSSQL connection and virtual environment
4. **Import Failing:** Validate CSV format and encoding

### Useful Commands
```powershell
# Check server status
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test search functionality  
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/flashcards/search?q=system"

# View git history
git log --oneline -10

# Database connection test
python -c "from app.database import engine; print(engine.connect())"
```
