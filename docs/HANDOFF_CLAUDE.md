  - `services/google_tts_service.py` - Audio generation
  - `services/audio_service.py` - Audio file management  
  - `services/ai_service.py` - OpenAI integration
- **Routers:** RESTful API endpoints in `routers/` directory
- **Scripts:** `runui.ps1` - Production startup script with timing

### Frontend (`/frontend/`)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** SPA with tab-based navigation
- **Main App:** `app.js` - Core application logic and state management
- **Audio Player:** `audio-player.js` - TTS playback and regeneration
- **Responsive UI** with Tailwind-inspired styling

### Database Schema
- **flashcards** - Core card data with multimedia URLs
- **languages** - Supported language definitions
- **users** - User management (prepared for future)
- **study_sessions** - Learning progress tracking (prepared)

## üõ†Ô∏è **DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT**

### Setup Commands
```powershell
# Start application (recommended)
.\runui.ps1

# Manual backend start
cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend (if separate)
cd frontend && python -m http.server 3000
```

### Key URLs
- **Application:** http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:8000/health

### Dependencies
- **Python:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Google Cloud TTS, OpenAI
- **Database:** MSSQL Server with integrated authentication
- **Frontend:** Modern browser with ES6+ support

---

## üìä **TECHNICAL DECISIONS & LESSONS**

### ‚úÖ **What's Working Well**
- **Google TTS:** Superior to OpenAI for pronunciation quality and speed
- **Timestamped Audio Files:** Effective cache-busting strategy
- **Service Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns
- **OR Search Logic:** Standard behavior for multi-field search
- **FastAPI:** Excellent API framework with automatic docs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Considerations**
- **Startup Time:** 35-second cold start due to dependency loading
- **Frontend State:** Manual refresh required after async operations  
- **IPA Support:** Present but not actively used (could be expanded)
- **Offline Support:** Basic PWA setup but could be enhanced

### üîß **Architecture Strengths**
- **Modular Design:** Easy to add new languages and features
- **RESTful APIs:** Clean integration points for extensions
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Good debugging and monitoring
- **Error Handling:** Robust user feedback and recovery

# Check server status
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test search functionality  
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/flashcards/search?q=system"

# View git history
git log --oneline -10

# Database connection test
python -c "from app.database import engine; print(engine.connect())"
```
