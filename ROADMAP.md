# Super Flashcards - Product Roadmap
**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025  
**Current Version:** 2.6.12  
**Status:** Approaching MVP

---

## üéØ Current Sprint - Pending Tasks

### High Priority (Blocking MVP)
- [ ] **Investigate tabs broken after document upload** - User reported Study/Read/Browse tabs don't work after uploading document
- [ ] **Test Greek words batch workflow end-to-end** - User needs to test v2.6.12 with hard refresh
- [ ] **Fix deployment issue** - Backend deployment failed (may not need redeployment if only frontend changed)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Clean up hamburger menu** - User wants to remove all items except Import (or remove hamburger entirely)
- [ ] **Complete production regression testing** - Verify all features work after v2.6.9-2.6.12 changes

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Document v2.6.12 testing results** - After user tests, document what works/doesn't work

**Key Decisions:**
- ‚úÖ **Eliminate manual card creation** - All cards AI-generated for quality and consistency across all tiers
- ‚úÖ **Google TTS only** - Eliminated OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and other TTS providers (Google won on quality/cost/reliability)
- ‚úÖ **Subscription differentiation** - Based on content access (# of cards, # of languages, features) not quality

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Monetization Considerations
- **Stripe** is recommended for payment processing (best developer experience, handles most edge cases) Yes, go with Stripe.
- **Freemium limits** should be generous enough to evaluate the product but restrictive enough to encourage upgrades - Yes on all below.
  - 50 cards is enough to learn basics of a language
  - 5 AI generations/day allows trying the feature but not serious use
- **Annual discount** (17% off = $99/year vs $9.99/month) encourages commitment and improves retention
- **Enterprise tier** targets language schools, corporate training, universities. Not yet. Wait for above to work in prod.

### Technical Debt to Address

#### High Priority
- [ ] **Staging/Test environment** - Deploy separate test instance before touching production
  - **Why:** Currently deploying directly to prod is risky - one mistake affects live users
  - **Solution:** Create `super-flashcards-staging` Cloud Run service, test there first
  - **ROI:** Prevents production outages, allows safe experimentation

- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automate testing and deployment
  - **Why:** Manual deployments are error-prone (running from wrong directory, forgetting version bumps)
  - **Solution:** GitHub Actions to auto-deploy on push to `main` (staging) and `production` branches
  - **ROI:** Faster releases, fewer human errors, automated tests before deploy

#### Medium Priority
- ‚úÖ **Server-side storage with multi-device sync** - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
  - **Current:** MS SQL Server database in Google Cloud (production)
  - **Features:** All flashcards stored server-side, synced across all devices
  - **Verified:** Desktop and iPhone both access same cards from cloud database
  - **Offline:** Read-only access via IndexedDB cache (no local edits)
  - **Status:** Working perfectly - users can access cards from any device

- [ ] **User authentication** - Add login/signup to associate cards with user accounts
  - **Current:** Everyone shares the same flashcard database (no user isolation)
  - **Needed:** User accounts so each user only sees their own cards
  - **Database:** SQL Server already set up, just need to add user_id foreign keys
  - **ROI:** Required for monetization (can't charge without user accounts)

- [ ] **Error tracking & monitoring** - Better visibility into production issues
  - **Current:** Console logs (browser-side only, we don't see users' errors)
  - **Needed:** Sentry or similar to capture errors from all users in production
  - **Why:** Currently we only know about bugs when user reports them
  - **ROI:** Proactive bug fixes before users complain, better user experience

#### Low Priority
- [ ] **End-to-end testing** - Automated tests that simulate real user workflows
  - **Current:** Manual testing only (you test after each release)
  - **Tool:** Playwright or Cypress to automate: "Create card ‚Üí Study ‚Üí Delete" flows
  - **ROI:** Catch regressions automatically, faster testing, confidence in releases
  - **Cost:** Takes 1-2 weeks to set up initially, then saves time on every release

- [ ] **React migration** - Keep vanilla JS for now
  - **Current:** Vanilla JavaScript works well, no performance issues
  - **When to migrate:** Only if app becomes too complex to maintain (not yet)
  - **ROI:** Better component reusability, larger talent pool, but significant rewrite cost
  - **Decision:** Defer until after monetization is working

### Open Questions & Answers

#### 1. Frontend Framework Migration?
**Decision:** Stay with vanilla JS for now
- **Current state:** App works well, no performance issues
- **If React:** Better component model, larger talent pool, easier to hire developers
- **Cost:** 3-4 weeks to rewrite everything, high risk of introducing bugs
- **ROI:** Not worth it until app complexity increases significantly (Sprint 15+)

#### 2. Mobile App vs PWA?
**Decision:** PWA (Progressive Web App) is sufficient for now

**What is PWA?**
- Web app that works like a native app (offline, home screen icon, push notifications)
- Users visit website, click "Add to Home Screen" and get an app icon
- **Current status:** Your app already has PWA support (manifest.json, service worker)
- **iPhone home screen:** Should already work! Try: Safari ‚Üí Share ‚Üí "Add to Home Screen"

**vs Native Mobile App:**
- **React Native/Flutter:** Separate codebase, app store approval, updates slower
- **Cost:** $20k-50k to build + ongoing maintenance
- **ROI:** Only worth it if we need: camera, fingerprint, background processing
- **Decision:** Stick with PWA until revenue justifies native app investment

#### 3. Offline AI Generation?
**How it would work:**
- Download small language model (1-2GB) to user's device
- Generate definitions without internet
- **Problem:** Models are large, slow on phones, quality worse than GPT-4
- **ROI:** Low - users rarely create cards offline, internet usually available
- **Decision:** Not worth the complexity

#### 4. Shared Decks Marketplace?
**Clarification:** You're right - this is already planned!
- All cards are globally shared
- Premium users can "follow" specific cards (personal curation)
- No separate marketplace needed - it's built into the core experience

#### 5. Anki Integration vs Build Our Own?
**What is Anki?**
- Popular desktop flashcard app (20+ years old)
- Uses spaced repetition algorithm (SM-2)
- Users want to export/import cards between systems

**Options:**
- **Build our own:** Full control, better integration, optimized for our UX
- **Anki integration:** Export to Anki format, import from Anki decks

**Decision:** Build our own + export compatibility
- Phase 1 (Sprint 11-12): Build custom spaced repetition
- Phase 2 (Sprint 13): Add Anki export for users who want both systems
- **Why:** Most users will only use our system, but power users want flexibility
