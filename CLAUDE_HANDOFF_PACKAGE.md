## üéØ Handoff Context Summary

### What We Just Accomplished
‚úÖ **Google OAuth deployed to production**  
‚úÖ **Database authentication fixed** (trailing space issue solved)  
‚úÖ **First user successfully logged in** (cprator@cbsware.com)  
‚úÖ **Production redirect loop resolved**  
‚úÖ **All code committed and deployed** (revision 00053-mz7)  
‚úÖ **Fast OAuth performance** (91ms response time)  

### Current System State
- **Production URL**: https://learn.rentyourcio.com
- **Backend**: Cloud Run (us-central1)
- **Database**: Cloud SQL (758 flashcards, 9 languages, 1 user)
- **Status**: Fully operational, ready for regression testing

### What's Happening Now
- User (Corey) is performing regression testing in parallel
- Planning next sprint while testing occurs
- Assuming minimal/no defects found in testing
- Goal: Define next development phase priorities

## üöÄ Strategic Questions for Claude

These questions from the handoff doc will help guide sprint planning:

1. **Regression Testing**: What happens if defects are found? Priority matrix?

2. **User Experience Priority**: Which Phase 2 features first?
   - Language selection UI?
   - Study session tracking?
   - Spaced repetition algorithm?
   - User dashboard?

3. **TTS Integration**: Should audio/pronunciation be prioritized?
   - Existing scripts available
   - Greek TTS testing already done

4. **Image Integration**: Priority for flashcard images?
   - Greek images already generated
   - URLs need fixing

5. **OAuth Publishing**: When to submit for Google verification?
   - Need privacy policy and terms of service

6. **Deployment Automation**: Add auto-deploy to cloudbuild.yaml?
   - Faster vs. more control

7. **Windows Performance**: Fix local OAuth delay (2-4 min)?
   - Local dev only, medium inconvenience

## üí° Recommended Reading Order

**For Quick Context (5 minutes)**:
1. README.md (production status section)
2. SPRINT_HANDOFF_OAUTH_COMPLETE.md (executive summary only)

**For Sprint Planning (20 minutes)**:
1. SPRINT_HANDOFF_OAUTH_COMPLETE.md (full read)
2. PRODUCTION_REGRESSION_TEST_PLAN.md (skim test categories)
3. Questions for Next Sprint Planning section

**For Implementation Details (when needed)**:
1. backend/create_missing_tables.sql (data model)
2. backend/app/routers/auth.py (OAuth patterns)
3. PROJECT_STRUCTURE.txt (file organization)

---

## üîë Key Technical Context

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud Run**: Stateless containers, K_SERVICE env var for detection
- **Cloud SQL**: SQL Server 2019 Express, public IP access
- **Secret Manager**: Passwords and API keys, mount as volumes
- **Cloud Build**: Builds images but doesn't auto-deploy (manual step required)

### OAuth Configuration
- **Testing Mode**: Currently restricted to test users
- **Redirect URI**: Must match exactly between Google Console and code
- **CSRF Protection**: Requires persistent SECRET_KEY across instances
- **Session Cookies**: https_only=True, same_site='lax' for production

### Database Schema
- **flashcards**: 758 existing records (Greek, French)
- **languages**: 9 languages defined
- **users**: OAuth user profiles
- **user_languages**: User's selected learning languages (empty, needs UI)
- **study_sessions**: Study tracking data (empty, needs implementation)

### Critical Lessons Learned
1. **Secret Manager**: Check for trailing whitespace in passwords
2. **Health Checks**: Distinguish between fake (fast) and real (actual DB test)
3. **Environment Detection**: Use K_SERVICE to detect Cloud Run vs. local
4. **Build vs. Deploy**: Two separate steps, build doesn't auto-deploy
5. **CSRF Protection**: Consistent SECRET_KEY required across instances

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Review Handoff Documents**: Start with SPRINT_HANDOFF_OAUTH_COMPLETE.md
2. **Understand Test Plan**: Review what functionality exists and needs testing
3. **Await Test Results**: Corey will report findings from regression testing
4. **Prioritize Features**: Discuss Phase 2-4 priorities based on test outcomes
